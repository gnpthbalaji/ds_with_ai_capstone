# Executive Summary

## Brazilian E-Commerce Analytics: Driving Customer Retention Through Data-Driven Insights

**Author:** Balaji Guntur 
**Date:** February 2026  
**Dataset:** Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset (Olist, 2016-2018)  
**Analysis Period:** 100,000 orders across 27 Brazilian states with 2 years data.

---

## Business Problem

The Brazilian e-commerce platform faces a **critical retention crisis**:
- **97% of customers never return** after their first purchase
- Only **3% repeat purchase rate** despite 58% five-star reviews
- **46% of orders delayed**, causing significant customer dissatisfaction
- **1.73 star average drop** in reviews for delayed deliveries

**Core Question:** What drives customer satisfaction, and how can we optimize operations to maximize customer lifetime value?

---

## Methodology

### Four-Phased Analytical Approach:

**Phase 1: Descriptive Analytics** (What is happening?)
- Analyzed 100K orders, 99K customers, 33K products
- Identified growth trajectory and platform maturity phases
- Discovered 97% one-time customer problem

**Phase 2: Diagnostic Analytics** (Why is it happening?)
- Root cause analysis revealed delivery delays as primary driver (r = -0.37)
- Geographic distance significantly impacts delivery performance
- Category urgency affects customer delay tolerance

**Phase 3: Predictive Modeling** (What will happen?)
- Built Random Forest classifier (ROC-AUC: 0.694)
- Can identify 41% of poor reviews before they occur
- Validated delivery features as top predictors

**Phase 4: Prescriptive Analytics** (What should we do?)
- RFM customer segmentation (8 segments identified)
- Prioritized intervention strategies
- Created implementation roadmap with estimated ROI

---

## Key Findings

### 1. **The Retention Crisis** (97% One-Time Customers)

**Root Cause:** Marketplace model creates no platform loyalty
- Customers buy from sellers, not the platform
- 3% platform repeat rate vs. 1% category repeat rate
- Exception: home_appliances category (7% repeat rate)

**Insight:** Customers DO return to the platform but buy different categories each time (cross-category discovery works). The challenge is converting first-time buyers into that critical return visits and purchases.

### 2. **Delivery Delays Drive Dissatisfaction**

**Impact Quantified:**
- Delayed orders: **-1.73 stars** on average
- Strongest correlation: is_delayed (r = -0.37)
- **"Broken Promise Effect"**: Being late at all > how late you are
- 46% delay rate creates massive satisfaction drain

**Geographic Patterns:**
- Same-state delivery: **2-3 days faster**
- Different-state orders: **Higher delay rates**
- SP state concentration (42% of orders) creates logistics advantages

### 3. **Category-Specific Insights**

**High Performers:**
- **health_beauty**: Dominates revenue (low urgency + consumable)
- **home_appliances**: Best repeat rate (7% - sequential purchases)
- **bed_bath_table**: Consistent top category

**Delay Sensitivity:**
- **High urgency** categories (gifts, fashion): Punish delays 2x more
- **Low urgency** categories (furniture, home goods): More forgiving
- Category urgency matters as much as delivery time

### 4. **Predictive Model Performance**

**Random Forest Model (Best Performer):**
- ROC-AUC: **0.694**
- Precision: **45.6%** | Recall: **40.9%**
- Can proactively identify **41% of poor reviews**
- Deployment-ready at threshold = 0.5

**Top 3 Predictive Features:**
1. delay_days (30.4% importance)
2. delivery_days (25.6% importance)  
3. is_delayed (21.5% importance)

**Validates diagnostic findings:** Delivery performance is the primary controllable factor.

## Business Impact & Recommendations

### **Quantified Opportunity**

**Current State Costs:**
- 97% churn rate = unsustainable acquisition treadmill (has a population ceiling)
- 46% delayed orders = 1,654 poor reviews monthly
- Lost customer lifetime value = BRL 3.2M+ annually

**Improvement Potential:**
- Retention improvement (3% → 5%): **BRL 2.4M/year**
- Prevented poor reviews: **BRL 1.2M/year**
- **Total Revenue Opportunity: BRL 3.6M annually**

---

## Top 3 Strategic Priorities

### **1. ACTIVATE NEW CUSTOMERS** (Highest Impact)
**The 97% One time buyer is THE Problem**

**Actions:**
- Launch second-purchase incentive campaign (15% discount within 30 days)
- Implement onboarding email series (days 3, 7, 14)
- Cross-category recommendations based on first purchase

**Expected Impact:**
- Move repeat rate from 3% → 5% (+2 percentage points)
- **+900 repeat customers monthly**
- ROI: BRL 2.4M annually

---

### **2. FIX DELIVERY RELIABILITY** (Immediate Win)
**Focus on Promises, Not Speed**

**Actions:**
- **Immediate:** Set realistic delivery estimates (build 20% buffer)
- **Immediate:** Deploy predictive model for proactive intervention
- **Short-term:** Geographic matching algorithm (prioritize local sellers)
- **Medium-term:** Category-specific SLAs (premium for high-urgency)

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce delay rate from 46% → 35%
- Prevent ~400 poor reviews monthly
- Improve overall satisfaction by 0.3 stars

**Technical Implementation:**
- Use Random Forest model (threshold = 0.5)
- Flag 19% of orders for priority handling
- 14% ROI on intervention costs

---

### **3. BUILD LOYALTY MECHANISM** (Long-Term Foundation)
**Convert Platform into Destination**

**Actions:**
- Points-based loyalty program (tiered: Silver, Gold, Platinum)
- Subscription model for consumables (health_beauty, home_appliances)
- VIP benefits for Champions segment (500 customers, high LTV)

**Expected Impact:**
- Lock in repeat customers with switching costs
- Increase purchase frequency among existing repeaters
- Create platform affinity beyond individual sellers

---

## Customer Segmentation Strategy (RFM)

### **8 Segments Identified:**

| Segment | Size | Strategy | Priority Action |
|---------|------|----------|----------------|
| **New Customers** | 90K (97%) | **ACTIVATE** | 2nd purchase incentive |
| **Potential Loyalists** | 1.5K (1.6%) | **CONVERT** | Onboarding series |
| **Loyal Customers** | 800 (0.9%) | **UPGRADE** | Cross-sell campaigns |
| **Champions** | 500 (0.5%) | **RETAIN** | VIP loyalty program |
| **At Risk** | 300 (0.3%) | **WIN-BACK** | Re-engagement offer |

**Focus:** New Customers segment represents **97% of the opportunity** and must be the primary focus.

---

7. Full loyalty program launch
8. Seller performance management system
9. Subscription model for consumables

**Investment:** ~BRL 300K  
**Expected ROI:** Long-term retention improvement

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals that the Brazilian e-commerce retention crisis (97% one-time customers) is not primarily an operational problem, but a **strategic challenge**. While delivery optimization will improve satisfaction (and should be pursued), the fundamental issue is the marketplace model's inability to create platform loyalty.

**The path forward requires a three-pronged approach:**
1. **Immediate:** Fix delivery reliability to stop the satisfaction bleed
2. **Strategic:** Activate new customers through targeted retention programs
3. **Structural:** Build loyalty mechanisms to compete with marketplace dynamics

**With focused execution on these priorities, the platform can realistically achieve:**
- 3% → 5% repeat rate in 6 months (+67% improvement)
- 46% → 35% delay rate in 3 months (-24% improvement)  
- BRL 3.6M+ annual revenue impact from improved retention

**The 97% problem represents both the greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity.** Every percentage point improvement in retention translates to ~900 additional repeat customers and BRL 1.2M in annual revenue. The data shows the path—now execution is key.
